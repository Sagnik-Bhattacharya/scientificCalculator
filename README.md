#Scientific Calculator App
A feature-rich scientific calculator app built with React. It supports both basic arithmetic operations and advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometric calculations, logarithms, and roots. The app is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for both casual users and students who need to perform scientific calculations.

Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Advanced Functions:
Exponentiation (^)
Square root (sqrt())
nth Root (nthRoot())
Trigonometric Functions: sin(), cos(), tan()
Logarithms: log(), ln()
Factorial (!)
Parentheses for grouping expressions.
Support for the constant e (Euler’s Number).
Buttons
The calculator supports the following buttons:

Basic Functions: AC (Clear), (, ), /, *, -, +, .
Number Keys: 0-9
Scientific Functions:
Exponentiation: ^
Square root: sqrt()
nth Root: nthRoot()
Trigonometric: sin(), cos(), tan()
Logarithmic: log(), ln()
Factorial: !
Euler’s constant: e
Equals Button: =
Technologies Used
Frontend: React
State Management: React useState Hook
Styling: (If using CSS, mention it here. If using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material UI, mention that as well.)
Version: 1.0.0

Usage
Open the app in your browser.
Use the numeric buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
Select any scientific function from the buttons like sin(), sqrt(), log(), etc.
Use the arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for basic calculations.
Press the equals button (=) to evaluate the expression.
Press the "AC" button to clear the display.
Example:
Input: sin(30) + sqrt(16)
Output: 0.49999999999999994 + 4 = 4.5
